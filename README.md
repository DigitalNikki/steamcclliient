# Here be dragons


## Usage 
```scc <command> <appid>```

Available commands are: ```install``` ```uninstall``` and ```run```

Make sure steam client is installed, but not running before using scc.
Also keep in mind that it's a pre pre alpha and it might be unstable or just dangerous to use (especially after client updates).
Each command execution with valid args will perform log in to steam network so you probably shouldn't spam commands too often either.
